00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,610
Greetings everyone.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,020
In this video, I am going to show you how
you can install, run and use famous Stable

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,179
Diffusion web UI developed by Automatic1111
with two different ways.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,270
The first way I am going to show is using
an open source installer exe just like in

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,240
traditional applications we install.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,699
The second way will be manual installation
of the web UI.

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,310
This exe is developed by one of the Stable
Diffusion community members Leo Mozoloa as

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,640
can be seen here, this is his profile.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,360
Usually I do not trust any exes, however,
this one is an open source application and

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,590
you can compile it from the source code.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,690
You can also check all of the source code
on the GitHub repository.

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,780
This link I will put it in the description
of the video and we can go inside the folders

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,850
and see each one of the code it contains.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,780
Therefore in this case, we can trust it.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,030
So let's begin with downloading the installer
exe.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,590
So where do we download it?

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,010
We download it from the releases.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,729
The releases are displayed at the right as
you can see here with my mouse.

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,040
When I click it, I can see all of the releases.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,260
Just click the exe and it will start downloading.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,281
By the way, you may get a message like this.

22
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,960
This exe is not commonly downloaded and may
be dangerous.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,250
If you see that just right click here and
click.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,630
Keep OK.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,670
After the download has been completed, just
go to your downloads folder.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,680
Right click the exe and run as administrator.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:40,420
It is important to run as administrator because
this exe will download and install files.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,070
Don't worry about that because it is hosted
on the GitHub repository.

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,500
Also this application is now pinned by moderators
of the stable diffusion community and also

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:59,920
I have compiled myself this exe by using advanced
installer application and I have verified

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
it.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,350
This application you can also download trial
and try, but it is not necessary for you.

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,860
OK, now this is the installer exe beginning
screen.

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,489
We need to install Python and this exe will
do that as well.

35
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:15,360
So you see there is GIT and Python.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,660
I click next.

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,250
It will do everything automatically for us.

38
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:29,379
If you encounter any problem during following
this tutorial, please go to our page YouTube

39
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,379
page.

40
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,150
Click about and here you will see our Discord
channel.

41
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,710
Just click it and join our Discord channel
and ask me any questions, any problems that

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,720
you encounter.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,700
The Python installation may take some time,
so be patient with that.

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,519
OK, so the Python installation and the git
installation has been completed, so there

45
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
are several options.

46
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,990
You should pick clean install if you are going
to override your existing or previous install.

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,980
You should also click this box.

48
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,650
Install SD checkpoint 1.5, version 1.5 and
the newest vae.

49
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,980
These are, I am explaining what are these
in our another video.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,280
So if you are wondering what are these version
1.5 and new vae you can go to our channel.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,439
Click playlist and in here you will see stable
diffusion dreambooth click that playlist and

52
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,430
in here you see we have how to use SD 2.1
custom models on Google Colab or we have how

53
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,700
to use stable diffusion 2.1 and different
models in Web UI.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,060
This video actually will explain to you a
lot regarding what are these.

55
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,390
OK, so now I am going to pick the folder where
I want to install.

56
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,610
I want to install it inside my C drive.

57
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,180
So I am clicking the three dots here to pick
the folder.

58
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,069
I am clicking C and in here I am clicking
select.

59
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,490
You see now it is selected in the root folder,
but I need to have another folder.

60
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,440
So I am going to type like a1111WebUI.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,449
OK and then I am clicking I understand and
click install.

62
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:30,720
Now it will also download the necessary files
for me and we don't need to do anything manually.

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,450
During the download, it doesn't show you any
messages.

64
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:40,280
However, if you open your task manager with
right click and click task manager like here,

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,760
you can go to ethernet and you can see how
much download your computer is doing.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,960
As you see, currently I am downloading like
100 megabits, which is my maximum bandwidth.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,610
OK, after the file files has been downloaded,
it will quickly install them and it will open

68
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,140
the installed folder.

69
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,270
As you can see, the folder is like this.

70
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:14,210
Now we have launcher generated by our installer
and we have the GitHub folder of the official

71
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,710
Web UI.

72
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,630
It is this one and it has automatically downloaded
it for us and set it up.

73
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,500
And we have the launcher shortcut icon.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,000
You can also pin this to taskbar, send it
to your desktop, whatever you do.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,780
For example, I will send it to my desktop,
send to desktop.

76
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:42,400
And now in my desktop I have it and it has
been installed.

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,710
As you can see now, I am clicking finish and
now we can run it from directly from the launcher.

78
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,740
It is asking me asking me to do I want to
launch the from its shell command?

79
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,580
And I said yes.

80
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,539
And now the shell command has been run and
the automatic Web UI launcher has been started

81
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,190
so we can do automatic update.

82
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,340
As you can see, the arguments are getting
setted it in the left.

83
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,970
Automatic update extensions, clear generated
images.

84
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,639
You shouldn't pick this if you if you know
what you if you're not sure what is this doing.

85
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,780
Low VRAM.

86
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,919
If your graphic card is lower than 8GB, then
you should check this.

87
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,789
I have RTX 3060.

88
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:39,500
The RTX 3060 is a super card, super card for
machine learning tasks.

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,990
And I already have a video regarding that
on my channel.

90
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:53,380
If you wonder how powerful it is, you can
check that video, this one and read the comments

91
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,490
that people made.

92
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,340
You should also click enable xformers.

93
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:08,509
This enable xformers will improve your speed
if your graphic card is supporting that.

94
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,379
There are also optional checkpoint folders
and default vae files.

95
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,210
If you don't know this yet, you shouldn't
change them.

96
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,100
But if you want to learn more about them,
just go to our page, click videos.

97
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:29,430
And from here, find how to use stable diffusion
version 2.1 and different models in the web

98
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,430
UI video.

99
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,510
This video will help you tremendously to understand
them.

100
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,810
I will also put a link of this into the description
of the video.

101
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,580
There are also additional launch options,
and you can also type them.

102
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,150
Currently only this one is typed.

103
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,900
You should also type here.

104
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,949
--no-half.

105
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:57,000
This will make it work with stable diffusion
version 2.1.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,330
And I am also explaining that in this video
as well, how to use stable diffusion 2.1.

107
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,790
And that's it.

108
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,750
That's all we need to start.

109
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,450
And then we click launch web UI.

110
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:17,479
It is generating a virtual environment for
Python.

111
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,639
This is only first time initialization and
you won't need it.

112
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,560
So you see it has installed Python 3.10 version.

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,659
This is one of the supported versions by the
web UI 3.10.8.

114
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,458
If you have different Python installations
in your computer, it is fine.

115
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:47,700
It will use the latest installed one because
I am assuming that the web this installer,

116
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,860
installer will set the default Python path
in the environment variables.

117
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,890
Now we are waiting it to install necessary
other files, for example, torch and torch

118
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,890
vision.

119
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,709
These are necessary to run the stable diffusion
model and generate images.

120
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,670
OK, so the installation has been completed.

121
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,800
You see, I don't have any error messages.

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,050
This is really important.

123
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:24,300
And then it will automatically start the web
interface that we can do image generation

124
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,830
and image manipulation with stable diffusion.

125
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:34,829
OK, by the way, you need a decent graphic
card to make it work with many of the features

126
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,910
of this AI model.

127
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,650
If you don't have such graphic card, then
on our channel, you can go to playlists.

128
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:53,390
And in here, click the stable diffusion and
watch these transform your selfie and how

129
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,780
to use SD 2.1 custom models on Google Colab.

130
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,300
Both of the videos explaining how to use stable
diffusion on a Google Colab notebook, which

131
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,040
uses the GPU provided by the Google.

132
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,440
So you don't need a strong GPU.

133
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,000
However, in this tutorial, we are going to
use our own computer's GPU.

134
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,170
As you can see, my GPU is already being used
a lot, but it is fine.

135
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,220
Now everything is ready.

136
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,000
First, we need to pick the model that we want
to use, which is this one automatically downloaded

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,840
and got ready for us.

138
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:43,160
Now we can enter prompts and generate images
and use all of all other features.

139
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,490
So in this video, I will just generate one
image.

140
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,649
Okay, I have entered my prompt as like this
and my negative prompt.

141
00:10:51,649 --> 00:11:00,450
I have selected the sampling sampler as DPM++
SDE Karras and other options are like default.

142
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,339
If you want to learn more about this, please
watch the other videos in the channel because

143
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,060
these are all different things.

144
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,340
I will also show one another thing.

145
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,630
Just click this image and send to extras and
in here you can upscale it.

146
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:26,240
The one of the best upscaling algorithm I
have found is R-ESRGAN 4x+ and let's upscale

147
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,750
it to three times and just click generate.

148
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:38,490
This will also download another necessary
model file for R-ESRGAN 4x+.

149
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,350
It is not very big as you can see.

150
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,480
Then you will see it is generating the upscaled
image and it is ready.

151
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,070
When we click it now you see it is upscaled.

152
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,920
Okay, so this is all for automatic installation
with using the installer.

153
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,230
Now I will show how you can install and run
everything manually.

154
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,660
Okay.

155
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,670
The manual installation is tedious as you
can imagine.

156
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,810
First we are opening the GitHub repository
of the stable diffusion web UI.

157
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,540
I will put the link in the description.

158
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,600
Then click code and from here click local
and from here download as zip.

159
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,130
This will download the entire folder and it
is it has been downloaded pretty fast.

160
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,449
Cut it and then go to the folder that you
want to.

161
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,590
You want to install it.

162
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:42,260
So I will generate a new folder in C drive
and let's say webUI2 okay and paste it in

163
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,250
there.

164
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,620
And in here right click and extract here.

165
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,769
This is a zip file.

166
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,699
Okay I will cut and everything inside inside
here and I will paste them inside here.

167
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:04,339
Okay by the way, whenever the source code
gets updated in this repository, you have

168
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,459
to manually update it.

169
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:10,519
It won't be updated automatically.

170
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,959
Okay so to make this work, we need to have
installed python.

171
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,850
So how we are going to install python.

172
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,389
The suggested python version is python 3.10.6
and when you click it it will open all of

173
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,570
the python versions.

174
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,720
Do not download the latest python because
it won't work.

175
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,839
Some of the things are not compatible with
the latest version.

176
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:54,320
So from here we go to we are going to search
control-F 3.10.6 here and from here we go

177
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,779
to files and from here click windows installer
64 bit it will get installed.

178
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,760
Currently I have this installed but we can
reinstall it.

179
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,630
I am going to show in folder right.

180
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,769
Click and run as administrator.

181
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:17,449
Okay and in here you see there are install
now and customize installation and add python

182
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,560
to add python to path.

183
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,680
This is important.

184
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,500
If you don't make this, it won't work.

185
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,520
Okay I will click customization.

186
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,089
Everything is selected next.

187
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,269
Then you can pick the folder where you want
to install.

188
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:40,269
I want to install it in C drive with version
2 like this and you can also click precompile.

189
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,600
Okay this should be enough sufficient.

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,910
Click install.

191
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,970
Okay you see I have an error because another
version of this product is already installed.

192
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:58,790
Okay I am uninstalling the pythons version
3.11.0 and 3.10.8.

193
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,660
This is the one that has been installed by
the automatic installer and then we will manually

194
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,079
install this one to demonstrate.

195
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:17,019
Okay both python versions has been uninstalled,
so let's install 3.10.8 version.

196
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,089
Okay which is here I am clicking it I am clicking
the download.

197
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:29,889
I will also put a link of this into the description
show in folder right click run as administrator.

198
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,490
Okay you add python exe to path customize
installation.

199
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,110
Next, let's pick the folder to install.

200
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,430
Okay let's name it like this: precompile.

201
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,670
Okay install.

202
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,290
Okay now getting installed.

203
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:53,250
Hopefully it won't cause any errors.

204
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,899
Okay the python has been installed successfully.

205
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,589
Let's first verify it.

206
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,449
Open a command line window with typing cmd.

207
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:08,320
Like this command, prompt, enter and in here
just type python.

208
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:19,459
Okay you see my default python is 3.9.9 therefore,
it may not work and it will not work actually.

209
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,800
So I have to fix it from environment variables.

210
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,089
If you if you didn't have any installed python,
then it should automatically work for you.

211
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:38,880
So I am going to add I'm going to add it to
my edit path and in here I am going to move

212
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,900
I am going to add my new installation.

213
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,960
Actually it is on the top so probably I need
to change the path here.

214
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,870
Okay let's see the newest installation is
not here, so click new and from here.

215
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,860
Click browse in here.

216
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,470
Go to C drive where we installed it.

217
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,569
We installed it in let's see python.

218
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:06,720
Yeah, in here first selected.

219
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,780
Move it to the top.

220
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:20,839
Okay then I will just edit this actually the
bottom one.

221
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,299
Okay for editing, click edit and click browse
and go.

222
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:37,590
Okay in here python and in here I'm selecting
scripts okay, click okay, click okay and you

223
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,380
need to open another cmd command prompt window
type python.

224
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:51,570
Okay now you see my default python is 3.10.8.

225
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,380
Now we are ready to move to the next step.

226
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:02,890
So I am entering the folder where I have extracted
the GitHub files and in here first I need

227
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,960
to edit web user.bat file.

228
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,990
Right click it and click edit I need to add
2 command line arguments.

229
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:21,100
The arguments we need to add are --xformers
space character and --no-half and then click

230
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
save.

231
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,539
Okay now we are ready to launch the interface.

232
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:34,799
We are going to webui-user.bat and it will
generate first a virtual environment as same

233
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,460
as in the previous methodology.

234
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,070
Okay the installation has been completed,
but we have an error.

235
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:50,100
The error is that it says that we don't have
any model to run the stable diffusion.

236
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,760
So first we need to download and install our
model.

237
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,400
As I have already said multiple times, I am
fully explaining different models and how

238
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,080
to use them with the web ui in this tutorial
video.

239
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:18,470
So from here I am going to click official
repository actually not official repository.

240
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:26,600
So let's download not the official model,
but let's download anything v3 model: this

241
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,530
is a very famous model and from here I am
going to click anything v3.

242
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,840
I will use the pruned file.

243
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,870
Okay, just download it alternatively, you
can also download the official version just

244
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,260
click stable diffusion.

245
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,809
Actually, this could be hard.

246
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:57,430
So in google, just type stable diffusion version
1.5 if you type it to the google, it will

247
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,850
bring you the hugging face page.

248
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:12,309
From here and from here click files and versions
and from here click v1-5-pruned.ckpt and from

249
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,810
here click download it will get downloaded
like this as you can see.

250
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:24,590
Okay, once downloads has been completed, go
to your downloads folder, select the files,

251
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:34,180
click cut, and then go back to the installation
folder of the web ui and in here go to models

252
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:42,039
folder and in here go to stable diffusion
folder and this is the place where you are

253
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,670
going to paste, put your full models that
you have downloaded.

254
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,990
I am explaining everything in the other video
that I have mentioned and then go back to

255
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,809
web user dot file.

256
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:02,159
Okay, I'm closing the other command windows
and this time it will be much faster because

257
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,549
the initial step has been completed.

258
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:10,940
You see it is launching the web ui with the
arguments minus minus xformers and minus minus

259
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,600
no half.

260
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,409
Okay, okay so it is ready, but you see it
didn't open me any pages.

261
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:25,180
So you need to type this into your browser
or you can copy and paste it.

262
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,779
I am selecting it with my mouse right click
actually right click not working.

263
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:35,500
You need to select it with your mouse, then
control-c it will copy it and then you need

264
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,029
to paste it into your browser and it will
get opened.

265
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,300
Currently it is running.

266
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Let's generate a new image with the same prompt.

267
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,220
I will post this prompt into the comments
section of the video.

268
00:21:51,220 --> 00:22:01,360
I am selecting DPM++ SDE Karras this is the
sampling method and this is one of the good

269
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,789
ones that I have found.

270
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:10,120
Then click, generate and and you you are seeing
that it is generating each step.

271
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,910
You will see the progress here and also here.

272
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:19,049
Okay, the image has been generated, but you
see this is pretty different than the first

273
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,190
example.

274
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,340
Why?

275
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,330
Because currently it is using anything v3
model.

276
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,359
However, in the previous example, we were
using version 1.5 which was the official version.

277
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,940
If I change back model to that version and
generate another image, let's see what we

278
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,490
are going to get and this is what we get with
the official 1.5 version model.

279
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,220
Okay, this is all for today.

280
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:55,289
Please subscribe our channel and follow our
videos because I am planning to make a full

281
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:01,720
course regarding stable diffusion with explaining
pretty much everything about it.

282
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,630
You can see it in our playlist in the stable
diffusion.

283
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,470
I will put them with an order.

284
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:16,549
I am generating videos both for Google Colab
and that will run on your computer.

285
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,140
To make it run on your computer, you need
a decent graphic card.

286
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:29,830
You see, even my RTX 3060 is struggling a
little bit.

287
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,630
So therefore, if you don't have a strong GPU
you can use Google Colab or other services,

288
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,590
but they are a little bit harder to use than
installing on your computer.

289
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:50,070
Please also consider liking sharing this video,
subscribing, and also supporting us on patreon.

290
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,680
This will enable us to continue produce more
high quality videos in the future.

291
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,049
Currently, we still have zero patrons, but
I am hoping that you will be the first one.

292
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,799
Hopefully see you in another video.
