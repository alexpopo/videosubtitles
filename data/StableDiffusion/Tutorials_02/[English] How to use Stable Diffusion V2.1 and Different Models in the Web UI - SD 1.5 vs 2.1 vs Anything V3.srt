00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Greetings everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
In this video, I will show you how you can use
Stable Diffusion 2.1 with Stable Diffusion

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,240
WebUI developed by Automatic1111.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,440
I am working on a full course that will hopefully
explain every detail about how to use WebUI

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
to fully utilize Stable Diffusion.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,760
So while I was trying to make version 2.1 work
with the WebUI, I had some difficulties.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,480
So let me show you how you can make Stable
Diffusion 2.1 work with the WebUI.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,400
This is the official page of the Stable Diffusion,
the Stability AI who releases the models.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,120
And this is their Hugging Face page
where they release their models.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,800
You see there are several models and Stable
Diffusion 2.1 and there is Stable Diffusion

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,880
2.1 base.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,480
So you may ask what is the
difference of them.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:07,080
The base version is 512 by 512 pixels and
the regular version is 768 and 768.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,760
So this is the latest and
the better version.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
I am going to use that on the WebUI.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,440
So I am clicking Files and Versions and I am
going to download the file which is ema

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
pruned.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
You see they are same file size.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,320
So you may wonder what is the difference. Ema
is for further optimizing, further tuning

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,160
the model.

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,360
So usually it was larger size,
but now it is same size.

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,260
So it is better to use that.

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,040
You see now I am downloading the file.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,080
Okay so the file has been downloaded.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,840
Let's go to our Downloads folder quickly.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,120
You see the file is here.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,040
I am going to cut it.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,080
And then where am I going to paste this is: I am
going to my installation of Stable Diffusion

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,520
WebUI and from there I am going to Models and from
there you see there is a Stable Diffusion

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
folder.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
I am going to paste it there.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Are we done yet?

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
No, we are not done yet.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,120
In the Stable Diffusion GitHub, there is a
file, it is inside the configs folder and

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
it is Stable Diffusion folder.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:24,360
You see there are YAML files, this is for configuration
and for 768 pixels, we are going

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,480
to use the one ends with the V. Okay,
this is the file that we need.

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
We are going to click raw.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,120
That's where I will put the links of these
files into the description of the video.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,200
And in here we are going to click Save As.

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,040
We are going to save as this inside our installation,
we go to our Models folder and in there we

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280
are going to Stable Diffusion folder
and we are going to save it in here.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Okay, are we done yet?

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
No.

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,200
This is saved as txt but its
extension has to be txt.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,520
Its extension has to be YAML.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,280
So if you are not able to see the extension
like this, you need to go to view and then

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,320
from here you see file name
and extension is checked.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,560
If I uncheck it, it is displayed
like this and it won't work.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,960
You need to check this from here and then you
need to right click, rename, delete the

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,760
dot txt, now click. Yes, it will become the correct
file extension, but we are still not

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
done yet.

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,480
We need to make these files same name. So I'm
going to right click and rename, I will copy

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
the name.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,800
You can also use Ctrl C, Ctrl V or F2 to rename.
So when I click F2 it will automatically select

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,000
and I will do Ctrl V and it
will be pasted like this.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,320
Okay, so now we are ready.

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:01,240
There is one final thing which is modifying the
command line of the BAT file that we are

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
running.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,760
So I'm going to open it with right click and open
with, there is no open with, so I'm going

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,280
to open it with my text editor
which is notepad++.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,600
You can also open it with notepad.

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,840
So to open it with notepad, I'm going to open
a notepad file like this and I'm going to

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,160
drag and drop it so it is opened
like this, you can see.

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,600
And from here we are going to set two command
line arguments which are like this: let me

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,280
zoom in, okay, --xformers
and --no-half.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,840
xformers is for boosting performance, if your graphic
card is not supporting you don't need

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,520
to put this and this is necessary for the newest
version, it increases its precision.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,960
So if you are wondering what are these command
line arguments, the command line arguments

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,160
of automatic1111 is released in its wiki.
Like this, I will also put this link into

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,200
the description and you see there are a lot
of command line arguments and you can see

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,120
what they are doing.

73
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,440
Okay so then we are saving it with file and
save and we are completely ready right now.

74
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,800
We are just clicking webui-user.bat and it will
start processing the necessary files.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay the messages displayed here is very important,
you see I have no error messages here, it

76
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,680
says that the config from this yaml is loaded and
the model file loaded from here, the weights

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:52,280
and xformers is applied and also it has loaded
the, let me see, hypernetwork that I have

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,440
developed and other things.

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,320
So I have no errors here, now we open the
webui like this, it shows the url in here

80
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,400
as you can see, you can
copy and paste that.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay from this left and top you can change the
models, so if I set the model like this,

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,840
let's see what happens.

83
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Okay after I have restarted the application, I
am now able to change the model on runtime.

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,160
So you see now it is changing the
model, loaded model on runtime.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay currently the model is loaded and
our model is now 2.1 with 768 pixels.

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,040
Okay so I have made a test with version 1.5.
I have generated 9 images of futuristic tank

87
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,600
artwork with the other all generic keywords and
with generic keywords of negative prompt.

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,760
I will put all of these positive and negative
prompts into the description and the comment

89
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,040
section of the video, so don't worry.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:06,720
I have used 20 sampling steps and DPM++ SDE Karras
as the sampling method. The native resolution

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:15,480
of 1.5 is 512 pixels by 512 pixels. So I didn't
change it. I made the batch count 9 and the

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,520
seed -1.

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
There is one another thing. Important thing that
I want to mention is that I have unloaded

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,120
all of the hypernetworks and embeddings. So this
is the raw test of the version 1.5, the

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,240
official version.

96
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:44,120
So each generation took about 15 seconds as you
can see on RTX 3060, okay and let's check

97
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,640
out the images right now.

98
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:55,000
So since they are native resolution 512 pixels,
their quality decreases when we display them

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
in a bigger screen like this.
The images like this.

100
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,200
I think they are pretty low quality. Since we
didn't use any artist style, we have only

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,500
used generic artworks, generic
keywords, okay.

102
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,240
Okay now we are seeing results of version 2.1
with the exactly same setup, exactly same

103
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,880
parameters, only I have changed it to native resolution
as can be seen here. 768 and I have

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:31,300
changed the model on the runtime as can be seen
here, you see it says that model loaded.

105
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,080
Let's check out the images
it has generated, okay.

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,600
So you see since the resolution is bigger, it
is looking better when we do increase in

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,040
size when displaying, okay.

108
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,720
Yeah definitely better than version 1.5 but this
is because in our prompts we didn't use

109
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:06,560
any of the style of the existing artists, okay.
We have only used the generic keywords.

110
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,040
That is why it is like this.

111
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:20,760
Also the inference time is more than two
times of the regular 1.5 version, okay.

112
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:28,760
So this time we are seeing analog diffusion results.
This is another model that is popular

113
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,000
so you see I have changed it on the runtime again
and it takes same about time. With the

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,520
original model 1.5. The results are like this
as you can see. I can say that it is not very

115
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:52,720
good by default for generating
this kind of images, okay.

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,680
To be able to use analog diffusion I have
downloaded the file from Hugging Face and

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,000
I have generated another YAML file as you can
see here, so where did I get this file?

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,160
This is the original 1.0 file which you can
find on this GitHub page. Let me show you,

119
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:23,320
it was, one second, here, yeah it is on this
page, it was also inside one of my folders.

120
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,400
So I have copied pasted there and it is the
same. I will also put link of this with the

121
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,560
same method as I have shown in the beginning,
you just save it and name it, okay.

122
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,600
Now this time we are seeing anything v3 model
results. I think it is pretty cool when we

123
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:54,200
consider it, it is older version 1.5 based
model, okay. Let's check it out, so I can

124
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:02,400
say that it is even better than version 2.1
as you can see, okay, I have used the same

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:10,480
setup and same settings, same prompt. So you
can try different models, it is always the

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,880
same principle. You download the model, you put
it inside the model folder and you generate

127
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,120
its YAML file, I don't know how this is pronounced,
so I am pronouncing it like that. You just

128
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,120
copy and paste this and rename it like this
one. So where you can get these models, you

129
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,880
can get those models on Hugging Face. So this
is the official repository. From here I am

130
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,240
clicking Stable Diffusion tag, so it is going
to search all models inside the Hugging Face

131
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:52,240
with Stable Diffusion tag and you see the Arcane
Diffusion or the anything v3, anything

132
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,960
v3 is in the top 4 actually as you can see here.
So you can also sort by recent updated

133
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,200
or you can sort by most likes, it is up to
you, you can try and test different models

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,800
from here, just download, copy, paste and change
the model from where, from here, click this

135
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,820
and it will refresh the models inside
your folder and you are ready to go.

136
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,040
